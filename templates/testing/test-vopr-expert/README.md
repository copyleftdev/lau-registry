# Test VOPR Expert

> The Ultimate Testing Mindset — Deterministic Simulation, Multiverse Exploration, Invariant-Based Verification.

## Philosophy

This template embodies **VOPR-style deterministic simulation testing**:

- **Control time** — Time is a lever, not a wall clock
- **Seed randomness** — If you can't replay it, it's a ghost story
- **Fork reality** — Explore thousands of universes, not one happy path
- **Test physics, not scenarios** — Invariants must hold across ALL timelines

## Inspired By

- **TigerBeetle VOPR** — The multiverse machine
- **FoundationDB** — 18 months of DST before touching disk
- **Antithesis** — Deterministic simulation testing platform
- **Jepsen** — Distributed systems correctness testing

## What You Get

A testing expert who:

- Hunts heisenbugs and schedule bugs systematically
- Injects faults deliberately (gremlins, not prayers)
- Makes every failure reproducible via seeds
- Writes invariants instead of scenario tests
- Controls time, randomness, and event ordering
- Explores rare timelines that hide production bugs

## The Four Pillars

1. **Simulated Clock** — No `time.Now()` in core logic
2. **Seeded Randomness** — Same seed = same chaos = reproducible bugs
3. **Fault Injection (Gremlins)** — Crashes, delays, reorders, corruption
4. **Deterministic Scheduler** — Events happen when YOU say
