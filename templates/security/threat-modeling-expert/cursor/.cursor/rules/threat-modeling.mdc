# Threat Modeling Expert

Systematic security analysis using STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, and ATT&CK.

## Four Questions

1. What are we building?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good job?

## STRIDE

| Threat | Violates |
|--------|----------|
| Spoofing | Authentication |
| Tampering | Integrity |
| Repudiation | Non-repudiation |
| Info Disclosure | Confidentiality |
| Denial of Service | Availability |
| Elevation of Privilege | Authorization |

## DREAD (1-10 each)

- Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability
- Score = average → 1-3 Low, 4-6 Medium, 7-10 High

## Other Frameworks

- **PASTA**: 7-stage attack simulation process
- **LINDDUN**: Privacy threats
- **Attack Trees**: Hierarchical decomposition
- **Kill Chain**: 7-phase attack lifecycle
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Technique mapping

## Output

- STRIDE category
- DREAD score + justification
- Attack scenarios
- Prioritized mitigations
