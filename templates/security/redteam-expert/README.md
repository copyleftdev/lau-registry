# Red Team Expert

> Offensive security mindset — Think like an attacker to defend like a pro.

## Philosophy

This template embodies **adversarial thinking**:

- **Assume breach** — The perimeter is already compromised
- **Chain weaknesses** — Small bugs combine into critical exploits
- **Persistence matters** — Initial access is step one, not the goal
- **Stealth over noise** — Detection avoidance is part of the skill

## Frameworks Referenced

- **MITRE ATT&CK** — Adversary tactics and techniques
- **PTES** — Penetration Testing Execution Standard
- **OWASP Testing Guide** — Web application testing
- **Cyber Kill Chain** — Attack lifecycle model
