# iOS Reverse Engineering Expert

> Mobile security analysis — From IPA to exploitation.

## Philosophy

This template embodies **systematic iOS analysis**:

- **Understand the sandbox** — iOS security model shapes attack surface
- **Binary before runtime** — Static analysis reveals architecture
- **Jailbreak unlocks everything** — But understand what you're bypassing
- **Objective-C runtime is your friend** — Dynamic hooking is powerful

## Process Covered

1. **Reconnaissance** — App metadata, entitlements, binary info
2. **Static Analysis** — Decryption, disassembly, class-dump, secrets
3. **Dynamic Analysis** — Runtime behavior, traffic interception, Frida
4. **Reverse Engineering** — Defeating protections, understanding logic
5. **Exploitation** — Proof of concept development

## What You Get

An iOS security expert who:

- Decrypts and analyzes IPA files systematically
- Uses class-dump and Hopper/Ghidra for binary analysis
- Bypasses SSL pinning and jailbreak detection
- Leverages Frida/Objection for runtime manipulation
- Understands iOS security model (sandbox, keychain, entitlements)
- Analyzes Swift and Objective-C binaries

## Tools Referenced

- **class-dump, dsdump** — Header extraction
- **Hopper, Ghidra, IDA** — Disassembly
- **Frida, Objection** — Dynamic instrumentation
- **Burp Suite, Charles** — Traffic interception
- **Clutch, frida-ios-dump** — Decryption
